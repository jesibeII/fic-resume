<h3>What fandoms have I created fic for?</h3>
<h4><em>Chronologically Ordered</em></h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Fairy Tail</b> (Unknown) </br><img src="https://images-fe.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/e94691913586a41106c0c1a6ab59cb7c1c9049ef9a7969b5036b8c23fdc42919._RI_TTW_.jpg" alt="the main characters from fairy tail" height="80"/>
        <ul>
            <li>This is where I got my start. On wattpad, I wrote and published many fics about Fairy Tail.</li>
            <li>Though I had a rough split with Fairy Tail, this is where I got my start.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>One Piece</b> (1) </br> <img src="https://cdn.oneesports.gg/cdn-data/2023/06/Anime_OnePiece_Wallpaper_StrawHatPirates_Complete.jpg" alt="the main characters of one piece in front of their ship" height="80"/>
        <ul>
            <li>My One Piece stint was short lived and comprised of Fairy Tail crossovers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>The Flash</b> (1) </br> <img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/03/8ccbb-16485652264411-1920.jpg" alt="cw's the flash title image" height="80"/>
        <ul>
            <li>More of a phase than anything, I wrote one fic for the Flash and promptly forgot it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Spider-Man (Tom Holland Movies)</b> (13) </br> <img src="https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/cc053686530ce446f0a27dc352961fac33dd12ac/c=1144-81-2630-920/local/-/media/2017/06/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636340759929048028-XXX-SPIDER-MAN-HOMECOMING-87249008.JPG?width=1486&height=839&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp" alt="tom holland as spiderman" height="80"/>
        <ul>
            <li>When I took up writing again, it was Tom Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man that drew me back in.</li>
            <li>Over the course of 11 fics, I began to make a name for myself and feel confident in my writing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Boku no Hero Academia</b> (65) </br> <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVjMmE0NDMtNjE5My00YTY4LWE1NWQtYzY3OWI5NzgwZjU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_QL75_UX500_CR0,0,500,281_.jpg" alt="midoriya izuku from boku no hero academia" height="80"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily the fandom that has consumed my soul and time the most.</li>
            <li>I started writing fic for BNHA at the start of college, and now, five years later, I am still creating fic for BNHA.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Easily one of the fics I am proudest of. I put my lifeforce and tears into this fic. It even changed my religious beliefs during the time I was writing it.</li>
            <li>If I were ot recommend any one of my fics, to be read without context, it would be this one.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Fullmetal Alchemist</b> (2) </br> <img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/15/a8e74cb7-393b-4b5d-a5b4-709fd4dce8d5/fmab-223459.jpg" alt="roy mustang and edward elric from fullmetal alchemist brotherhood" height="80"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite being in the FMA(B) fandom for years upon years, this is one of my newer endeavors.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to make it a long lasting one.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<!--TODO 3: Experience-->
<h3>How many years have I been writing fic for?</h3>
<h4><em>(too many)</em></h4>
<p>I have been writing fic since around 6th grade. 
    I wrote it obsessively and whenever I could. 
    I would write it on my phone or my ipad. 
    Anywhere I could really. 
    One of my clearest memories is of when I was writing fanfiction in a laundromat during a road trip I took with my mom. </p>
    <p>I haven't had a steady progression since then as I think I took a bit of a break at the beginning of high school. 
        But at that point I had made the transition from wattpad to fanfiction.net and to archiveofourown.org.
    Starting once again in 2018, I barely had time to stop.</p>
    <p>
        Currently, my total word count on archiveofourown.org is 797,917 words and is showing no signs of stopping.
    </p>
<!--TODO 4: Skills-->
<h3>What are my best skills?</h3>
<p>I would say I'm fairly good at writing in the present tense.</br> 
    My most common tags are fluff (17), angst (10), first kiss (7), kidnapping (7), amnesia (6), and hurt/comfort(6).</br>
    My most common pairings are Midoriya Izuku/Shigaraki Tomura (14), Peter Parker & Tony Stark (14), Bakugou Katsuki/Midoriya Izuku (13), Aizawa Shouta & Midoriya Izuku (8), and Shinsou Hitoshi/Midoriya Izuku (5).
</p>
